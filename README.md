# TFM Prediction

TFM Prediction is a project designed to predict traction forces in microscopy images using Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) techniques. This repository contains code and resources for developing and running predictive models to analyze and interpret TFM data.

## Overview

Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a powerful imaging technique used to measure the mechanical forces exerted by cells on their underlying substrates. By analyzing deformation patterns in the substrate, TFM provides insights into cellular mechanics, including stress distribution and cellular force generation.

This project focuses on using machine learning models to predict traction forces from microscopy images, enhancing the analysis and interpretation of TFM data.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop models to estimate traction forces from TFM images.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tools for preparing microscopy images for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots and visualizations to interpret results.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance with various metrics.


## Data

The data used for training and evaluation includes microscopy images and corresponding traction force measurements.
